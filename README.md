> The goal of this challenge is to test your familiarity with concepts in React Native.

## Task Instructions

- API:
  - Create stubs based on the user story selected
  - Mock those stubs (an easy way to do this is to use Postman)
  - Integrate with the mock stubs
- View:
  - Design reusable components that are used across all the screens relevant
  - Include any collateral/stock images (make sure these are okay for public use)
  - Include icons/vector art wherever relevant
- State Management:
  - Use redux for state management
  - thunk/saga for middleware
- Routing: Use React Navigation

## Instructions

> Follow the instructions provided to run the code on your computer

#### 1. Requirements:

- To begin with we must have node.js installed on our PC/Laptop. [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- To check if the installation is successful, open command prompt and run the following command:
  `node --version`

- We also have to download either one of our choice, Android Simulator or Expo App on our mobile devices.

  - To download the Expo app on Android, go to PlayStore and install `Expo`

  - For setting up Android Studio download and install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?hl=zh-cn). Follow the setup wizard in Android Studio and install any SDK packages that it recommends. Create a new project and press the `mobile icon` on the top right section of the window in the tool bar. Install the package for the android device you wish to emulate.

#### 2. Creating the Environment

> PLEASE NOTE that Expo has already been installed in this project, no need to execute the given instructions.

- Open command prompt and navigate to the desired folder where you want to save the project.
  Use `cd ` for navigation in Windows or access your desired folder

  Another method would be to type `cmd` in the address bar and press Enter to open a command prompt in that directory.

- Run the following commands

  `npm install`

  `npm install -g expo-cli `

#### 3. Running our project

- Open command prompt, navigate to the project folder or go to your project folder and type `cmd` in the address bar and press Enter to open a command prompt in that directory. Execute the command `expo start` . This will open the expo application in your browser.

- To run our app in Android Simulator, run your device emulator. In the expo application opened in the browser, select

  `Run on Android device/emulator`

- To run our app in our mobile device, open the `Expo app` and `scan the barcode`.
